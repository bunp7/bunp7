### About Me
Hi, I'm currently a MSc student at London School of Economics (LSE) studying Quantitaive Methods for Risk Management in the Department of Statistics. I previously graduated from Imperial College London with a MEng in Biomedcial Engineering.
My GitHub consists of projects and code related to both degrees and some personal projects.
